# NYC Department of Transportation: Art Installations Post-Pandemic

### New York City is an urban landscape that thrives on its multiculturalism. I wanted to use my second project to explore and evaluate the trends of publicly installed artworks across the five boroughs.

## Findings

#### My analysis reveals that since the pandemic, NYC’s public art installations have clustered heavily in pedestrian plazas and business improvement districts, especially in lower Manhattan, downtown Brooklyn, and parts of the Bronx. There’s a clear distinction in the type and density of artworks across boroughs, highlighting varying community engagement and funding priorities. Temporary and nonprofit-led installations dominate the landscape, reflecting a dynamic and adaptive urban culture. This distribution raises questions about equity in public art access and how these installations interact with neighborhood demographics.

## Process

#### I started by collecting and cleaning a dataset of publicly commissioned art installations in NYC from 2008 to 2025, but I wanted to narrow it down. I used Python to create a bar graph of the number of art commissions per year, and there were substantially more after COVID-19 – thus why I chose to analyze data from just 2021-2025. I used QGIS to analyze spatial patterns, mapping installations in relation to public schools and pedestrian zones. The interactive map was created with Mapbox, using Aaron’s scrollytelling template to build a narrative flow through the data. Throughout, I iterated between data analysis and visual storytelling to ensure the map communicated both trends and open-ended questions.

## What I Learned

#### This project deepened my understanding of geospatial data analysis and visualization tools like QGIS and Mapbox. I finally learned how to effectively produce a story using scrollytelling – a huge goal of mine coming into Lede!

#### Working with urban cultural data sharpened my perspective on how art can shape and reflect communities, and I am glad I was able to integrate my creative interests in this data-driven narrative. Overall, I learned the importance of balancing design and functionality in crafting engaging data narratives.

## Next Steps

#### Moving forward, I’d like to incorporate demographic and funding data to better understand equity in public art distribution. Expanding the timeframe and borough-level focus could uncover evolving trends and community impact over time. I also want to improve the interactivity by adding user filters for art type and program initiatives, as well as arrows and circles to point out where exactly the artwork is on the map. Finally, I'd interview local artists and city councilmen to enrich the storytelling with more context and voices.
